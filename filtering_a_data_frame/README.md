# Module Overview

One of the most commonly performed operations on a DataFrame is filtering. 
It essentially involves excluding some values to meet a condition or 
set of conditions.

We can filter in terms of observations (rows) or features (columns). 
Thankfully, Pandas is quite flexible and efficient for such operations.
In this chapter, weâ€™ll cover different methods that can be used to filter
both rows and columns in a DataFrame.
