# Data Analysis Pandas


### Data science and Pandas
Data science helps businesses extract insights from data and has become
tremendously popular in recent years. An increasing number of businesses 
have begun to recognize the potential value of data, so they’ve invested more 
in the data science workforce and technology.

The main contributor to the popularity of data science is that it’s
become easier than ever to collect, process, and transform data. Data comes 
from a variety of different resources, such as sensors, cash registers,
credit card transactions, banks, and so on. These are all examples of 
raw data.

In most cases, there are some issues with raw data that need to be handled 
in order to make it usable. Some typical issues in raw data are:

* Missing values.
* Being stored with the wrong data type.
* Not having a standard on the same type of values.
* Noisy data.

We’ll solve these issues through data cleaning, though it isn’t an
exhaustive process. We sometimes need to process the data to remove redundant
information or extract more useful information.

Suppose we’re analyzing a retailer’s data in the form of customer 
transactions. We have the customer ID, the purchased product information,
purchase date, and so on. However, we’re also interested in how often 
customers visit the store. We can find this information by calculating the
time difference between two consecutive purchases of each customer. The data 
is a highly valuable asset, but it needs lots of cleaning and processing.
